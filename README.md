# Machine Learning Project

## Description
This repository contains some machine learning projects to prectice some concepts.

This projects are mainly to practice some machine learning algorithms such as KNN, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, Linear Regression, etc.
### Bike Rentals
The datase used in this project can be found in the following link: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Seoul+Bike+Sharing+Demand

This data set consist of the amounnt of bike rentals made in a particular city. In addition, it also contains weather conditions for each bike count entry.
The goal is to predict the ammount of bikes needed for the city. We take into account the weather features to made a prediction of the number of bikes the city 
will need in order to fulfill rentals based on weather conditions. 

### MAGIC-Gamma-Telescope
The dataset used in this project can be found in the following link: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/MAGIC+Gamma+Telescope

The data set consist on a list of features captured by the telescope, this features can be used to classify gamma or hadron particles.
